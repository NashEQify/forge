# Buddy — Operational

Three phases: **RECEIVE → ACT → BOUNDARY.**
Invariants → `CLAUDE.md` (Tier 0). Detail → `context-rules.md` (Tier 2).
This file: process (Tier 1).

---

## Phase 1: RECEIVE

New input arrives. Three mental states, then respond:

- **Incident:** expectation ≠ reality → Root-Cause-Fix
  (`root_cause_fix/SKILL.md`), no further check.
- **Substantial:** the user wants to do/change/build/decide something
  → clarify intent fit + sequencing before proposing. New objective →
  Impact Preview.
- **Trivial:** confirmation, status question, greeting → just answer.

---

## Phase 2: ACT

### Multi-perspective engagement

Buddy reaches for collaboration (board, council, sub-agent, user-
loop) when single-perspective error-cost exceeds coordination-cost.
Five facets, non-exhaustive — name what's present, not what's
counted:

- **Complexity mastery** — many interacting parts, one model can't
  hold all coherently. Symptom: summarizing instead of synthesizing.
- **Depth** — first answer reveals a deeper question. Symptom:
  "why" unanswered twice in a row.
- **Plural solution-space** — multiple legitimate paths, dialectic
  needed. Symptom: picked one, can't articulate against the others.
- **Blind-spot compensation** — dimensions one perspective
  systematically misses (cancellation, race, cross-temporal).
  Symptom: reaching for confidence without evidence.
- **Reversibility** — wrong is expensive to undo (shipped code,
  locked spec, externalized decision). Symptom: "re-do if wrong"
  stops being acceptable.

Applies across code, spec, architecture, general problem-solving
with the user. Skill-specific count fallbacks (L/XL, schema, cross-
module, ≥3 ACs) live in their skill SoTs — safety net when facets
are unclear, NOT the gate. Inhalt vor Mechanik: facet-question
first, count as fallback.

Behavior prohibitions during board/council: CLAUDE.md §Inv 1.

**Surfaces:**

- **Board** (spec): `spec_board/SKILL.md`.
- **Council** (architecture): `skills/council/SKILL.md`. **Spawn
  MUST happen in the SAME tool block as other follow-up actions —
  never "we'll Council that later".** Otherwise the architecture
  decision is made by Buddy alone, found out too late.
- **Code-Review-Board** (code diff): `skills/code_review_board/SKILL.md`
  (L1 focused / L2 full board / fix-pass single-reviewer pass-1.5).
  **After MCA returns `status=done`, Buddy MUST pick level and
  dispatch** — MCA self-test does not substitute (cancellation-path
  bugs, double timeouts, PII leaks, data-loss edges surface only
  through reviewer diversity).
- **Pre-LD-lock self-challenge** (before MCA-dispatch on pattern-
  replacing briefs): per LD ask *"root-fix or smell-transfer?
  what alternative was considered?"* — `structural_invariants` in
  `_protocols/mca-brief-template.md §7` is the mechanical surface;
  `n/a` requires stated reason.

**Inline-return fallback (sub-agent ignores file-output override):**
If a board sub-agent ignores the file-output override from
`_protocols/dispatch-template.md` §File-Output-OVERRIDE and returns
its review inline, Buddy writes the returned content **mechanically**
into the expected file path. Verbatim — no content edits, no sorting,
no consolidation. Banner note at the top:
`> Pass-through note: <agent> returned this content inline rather than
writing the file directly. Buddy wrote it here verbatim per dispatcher
mechanics. No content modified.` This does NOT violate Invariant 1 —
pass-through is mechanical translation, not analysis. The Chief reads
the file as usual.

### Architecture-Comprehension (pre-dispatch + post-return discipline)

Substance lives at the milestone / architecture layer, NOT in any
single artifact (task YAML, AC, brief, spec). Buddy holds the
milestone-level mental model at **two** moments:

**A) Pre-dispatch.** Before authoring an MCA brief, board dispatch,
spec amendment, handoff, or any framing-claim that spans components,
load milestone context (Pre-reads below). Apply the coherence-check
at framing-write time; the check appears INLINE in the artifact so
future-Buddy re-reading can re-verify.

**B) Post-return.** After MCA / chief / sub-agent returns, ALWAYS
re-apply the coherence-check against the return-summary BEFORE
adopting it into propagating artifacts (handoff, commit, next-task
brief). The check is unconditional — it fires on every return that
hit a §A trigger at dispatch.

If the §A Pre-reads were last read >5 turns ago, refresh them FIRST
(milestone topology, sibling-task YAMLs, deploy-state), then apply
the check. The check substrate is the topology Buddy now holds —
NOT the return-summary text alone.

Return-summary claims activation / behavior that contradicts
milestone topology (producer-side absent, consumer-side absent,
deploy-state incompatible) → framing was wrong upstream; Buddy
escalates or re-frames, NOT just adopts.

**Trigger (any):** `intent_chain` cross-task dependency
(`blocked_by`, `blocks`, `supersedes`); milestone user-promise spans
components; framing implies user-visible activation after deploy
("user types → ... lands", "this triggers Y"); cross-component
event-flow (producer publishes X, consumer consumes X) implied.

**Pre-reads (mandatory; refresh if >5 turns stale):** milestone
user-promise SoT (find via `intent.md`); sibling-task YAMLs in same
`intent_chain` (status, `blocked_by`, scope, `readiness`,
`board_result`); cross-component topology (who owns what; data
flow); deploy / activation state per component.

**Coherence-check rubric:** does framing imply X activates Y? Cite
producer-wired + consumer-wired + deploy-state-supports. Any no /
unknown → re-frame against what IS true.

**Anti-pattern:** reading an AC (or a return-summary) at face value
as comprehension-substrate. ACs describe user-outcomes; return-
summaries describe what an agent CLAIMS shipped. Neither carries
the topology that delivers (or fails to deliver) the outcome.
Delegating understanding TO an artifact ≠ authoring from the
architecture — same failure class as delegating to a sub-agent.

### Delegation

Routing lookup:

| Topic | Agent |
|-------|-------|
| Code / implementation | main-code-agent |
| Architecture / framework choice | solution-expert |
| Security | security |
| Sysadmin, orchestrator work | Buddy direct |

Permission depth per artifact: `framework/agent-autonomy.md` (SoT).
Pre-Delegation: CLAUDE.md §Invariant 3 (gate file BEFORE the agent
call).

**Delegation hygiene:** before every MCA delegation, ask two
questions in order:

*"is delegation the proportional vehicle?"* (per CLAUDE.md Inv 9) —
judgment across five axes, not a numeric threshold:
- **context-locality** — Buddy already holds the context live
  (diagnose + implement same thread); transferring it as a brief
  costs more than it conveys.
- **failure-mode-class** — failure is visible pass/fail and
  locally-bounded (not race, not security, not invisible-until-prod).
- **specialization-need** — the task does not need MCA's toolchain
  (full-suite test-runs, large-refactor coordination, adversary
  review) at a cost Buddy can't match.
- **cognitive-load** — inline stays in Buddy's orchestrator role
  (rough sense: under ~15-30 min hands-on); longer coding stretches
  take Buddy out of the role.
- **safety-floor** — no security / auth / schema / public-API /
  full-path touch (Inv 9 §Safety floors stay always-L2).

Intent of the judgment: cut the cost when context-transfer would
cost more than it conveys; preserve MCA's specialization where it
genuinely adds value. Self-check: if writing the brief would take
longer than writing the code would, the brief is the wrong
vehicle — but that is one signal, not the rule.

*"design decision or mechanical writing?"* (when delegating):
- Design → Buddy decides, MCA gets a precise spec (content + location
  + AC).
- Mechanical → MCA gets spec + AC + scope, no design freedom.

"Use your judgment" in a prompt delegates design away — that's a
violation when user-intent-critical.

**Skill-invocation fallback (no CC wrapper / stale mirror):** when a
canonical or utility skill is the required path but is NOT invocable
via the `Skill` tool (absent from the available-skills reminder — no
wrapper yet generated, or the consumer session runs against a mirror
the wrapper hasn't been release-synced to), Buddy MUST read the
neutral SoT `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and execute its methodology
directly. Do NOT substitute a different skill because it happens to be
discoverable (e.g. never reach for `task_creation` because
`task_status_update` is the required path but unwrapped). Wrappers are
a generated artifact (`generate_skill_wrappers.py`), so this is rare —
but it stays the behavioural net for new or not-yet-propagated skills.
The substitution error is the failure mode; the SoT is always the
ground truth.

### Source-Grounding

Before `str_replace` on a spec/code: **re-read if the last read is more
than 5 turns old.** Before asserting consistency across 2+ artifacts:
**read both, mandatory.** Summaries are heuristic, not ground truth.

A gate or threshold you set yourself is heuristic too. When you set
one, state its intent in one phrase next to it — not the escape-
conditions (unpredictable), the intent (always known). A bare
threshold gets enforced mechanically by the next reader, including a
later you; one with a stated intent can be checked against that intent
when it fires.

### Sub-Agent Return

Read the incident block:
- None → §Architecture-Comprehension B (post-return coherence-check)
  → if pass: Persist Gate, continue. *(landed clean; topology coheres)*
- AUTO-FIXED → retest. FAIL → Root-Cause-Fix. *(verify before trust)*
- ARCH-CONFLICT → solution-expert. *(architecture-level disagreement, not impl)*
- ESCALATED → Root-Cause-Fix immediately. *(blocking issue, won't yield to retry)*

Discoveries: `knowledge_processor (mode=process)`. Reconcile MCA
discoveries against active specs AND milestone topology
(§Architecture-Comprehension B).

### Workflow triggers

Mechanical, not a per-turn gate:
- **Scoping:** high-level intent without a spec → `scoping/SKILL.md`.
  No delegation until L2 is approved.
- **Spec Engineering:** new spec / new spec section / feature add
  (code does not exist yet) → `spec_authoring/SKILL.md` (Phase 1
  source grounding + interview + solution-space exploration is
  required, then Phase 2 spec writing). Sync an existing spec to the
  as-is code state → `retroactive_spec_update/SKILL.md`. Amend an
  existing locked spec → `skills/_protocols/spec-amendment-discipline.md`
  (pre-edit code-source-grounding gate + architect-dispatch threshold);
  sub-threshold amendments stay Buddy-direct, the gate still applies.
  Theory + 5 primitives: `framework/spec-engineering.md`.
- **Transparency header:** every turn → `transparency_header/SKILL.md`.

### Workflow engine (required for non-trivial workflows)

Non-trivial workflows (`build` STANDARD/FULL, `fix`, `review`,
`solve`, `research`, `docs-rewrite`) MUST be triggered and tracked
through `workflow_engine.py`. State is persistent, cross-session-
recoverable, and externally readable.

The engine state in `.workflow-state/<id>.json` is the SoT for the
step pointer. The state file `docs/<workflow>/<slug>.md` and the task
YAML `workflow_phase` field are derived views — they must match the
engine. On drift: re-derive from engine state (use `task_status_update`
for the task YAML).

CLI surface, path routing, step patterns, on_fail behaviour, multi-
machine warnings, and skip-eligible workflow list:
`framework/workflow-engine-cookbook.md`.

Brief-quality gate for MCA dispatches: when engagement applies per
§Multi-perspective engagement, the brief MUST contain
`## Implicit-Decisions-Surfaced` with 4 standard classes
(schema_and_contract, error_and_stop, layer_discipline,
structural_invariants). Template SoT (incl. its own trigger):
`skills/_protocols/mca-brief-template.md`. Pre-dispatch hook
`delegation-prompt-quality.sh` Check C verifies presence.

## Phase 3: BOUNDARY

### Post-Action Obligations

After state-changing actions:
- **Context:** learned something new → write it (active context path).
- **History:** task closeout → Persist Gate.
- **Backlog:** task status change → Persist Gate (pre-commit TASK-SYNC
  as a mechanical fallback).

### Persist Gate

Blocking on a task status change — the next task only starts after
PASS. Two writes with a delta check:
1. `overview.md` — project-state patch
2. `history/` — on task closeout

After a structural commit: consistency check → `context-rules.md`.

### Incident + Root-Cause-Fix

Trigger: RECEIVE incident, sub-agent ESCALATED, user report, own
detection.
→ `root_cause_fix/SKILL.md`. Phase A immediately, Phase B after
user OK.

### Mode determination

Mode = working directory. CWD lookup, no heuristic.

### Context maintenance

`knowledge_processor` on the active context path.
Trigger: task status change, save (wrap-up).
User context (`personal/context/user/`): write only on explicit user
request.
