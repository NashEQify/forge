  accepts Forge's setup offer.

# Skill: setup

The user answers questions; you run the commands. Never ask the user to write or edit a file: every file this setup
touches is written by `forge_setup.py`. The framework root `<root>` is the directory that holds `.claude-plugin/`, two
levels above this skill's folder; take the absolute folder from the skill listing the host shows, or the one
`INSTALL.md` located. `S` below stands for `python3 <root>/scripts/forge_setup.py`.

## 1. Facts

Run `S status --project <project folder>` as its own call (the project folder is the session's working folder unless
the user named another). It prints JSON: the hosts found and their plugin roots, whether the project carries the
activation line, whether the user switch is on per host, the personal-context folder the machine setting names, and
the allow rules present. Decide from it; do not read or parse the host files yourself.

## 2. The choice

Unless the request already says it, ask one question: Buddy **in this project only** (one line in the project's
`AGENTS.md`, which teammates get when it is committed) or **in every session** (a setting in the user's home; Buddy
then also starts in folders without the line). Say what each means in one sentence.

For every session, also settle where personal context lives (who the user is, how they work, open topics, carried
across projects). If the status names a folder, offer to keep it. Otherwise propose `~/forge-context` and ask whether
to use an existing folder instead. A folder that does not hold `context/user/` yet is created or completed only on
the user's yes (`--create-user-repo`); the scaffold has headings only.

## 3. The writes

Run the one command that matches, as its own call; add `--dry-run` first when the user wants to see the changes:

| Request | Command |
|---|---|
| Buddy in this project | `S project --project <folder>` |
| Buddy in every session | `S every-session --user-repo <folder> [--create-user-repo]` |
| Back to this project only | `S every-session --off`, then `S project --project <folder>` if the project lacks the line |
| Buddy off in this project | `S project --project <folder> --off` |
| Remove Forge | `S remove --project <folder>` (each project the user names), then the host's uninstall commands in `<root>/INSTALL.md` §Remove |

The script writes for every host whose plugin it found, and prints what it wrote, what was already in place and
what it skipped. It is idempotent: running the same command again changes nothing. A refusal (exit 2) names the file
it would not overwrite (for example a settings file that is not valid JSON); report it and ask the user how to
proceed, without editing that file yourself.

After `project`, the activation line is a change in the project's `AGENTS.md`: tell the user, and offer to commit it.

## 4. The check

A setting takes effect in a fresh session; this session does not change. Check one:

- Claude Code: `claude -p "hi"` run in the project folder (every session: in a folder without the line).
- Codex: `codex exec "hi"` in the same folder (add `--skip-git-repo-check` outside a Git repository).

Pass: the reply opens with Buddy's orientation line (machine, time, folder). If the host cannot run a fresh session
from here (no login, a permission prompt), ask the user to open one and say whether the first reply opens with that
line. Report what you checked and what you could not.
