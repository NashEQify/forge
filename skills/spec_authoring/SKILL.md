# Skill: spec-authoring

## Guiding principle

**The spec defines the product. Incidents are fixed in the spec,
not in the code.**

Authoring = product decision act, not documentation. What is in the
spec gets built. When something surfaces during implementation that
the spec doesn't cover: **back to the spec**, don't improvise in
code. Theory (5 primitives, conventions):
`framework/spec-engineering.md`. Detail mechanics (grilling mode,
mediator audit, lessons-table, extended anti-patterns):
`REFERENCE.md`.

## When to call

- **Write a NEW spec** (greenfield).
- **NEW section in existing spec** when the section describes a
  feature that doesn't exist yet (interview for user intent required).
- User intent exists, no structured spec yet.
- Scoping mode (high-level intent → L0-L3) identified the need.
- Specify phase in build workflow.

**Feature additions to existing specs** = `spec_authoring`, not
`retroactive_spec_update`. The feature does not yet exist in code, so
no code evidence; user intent must be clarified via interview. When
unsure: code already exists? Yes → retroactive, no → authoring.

## Do not call for

- **Bring existing spec to as-is code state** → `retroactive_spec_update`.
- **Only review** → `spec_board`.
- **Cross-spec verify after amendment** → `spec_amendment_verification`.

## Phase 1 — Interview

Buddy interviews the user:

- Probe technical and difficult details; question edge cases.
- Surface concerns and trade-offs.
- No obvious questions — ask the hard ones.
- Don't stop until the spec is self-contained.
- **For NEW L1+ specs — bug-class elicitation:** for each draft AC,
  ask "what defect class does this AC guard against? at which test
  level?". Capture noun-phrase answers as `bug_class` rows in the
  §Test-Strategy catalog (Phase 2 checklist item 6). Dedup at
  elicitation; small variations within a bug class do not warrant a
  new row (per `testing/SKILL.md` proportionality rules). When in
  doubt, drop.

Goal: **uncover gaps together that neither saw before**, not "query
the user".

In a build, before the interview settles scope: read and follow
`workflows/runbooks/build/lifecycle.md` (which conditional stages, UX
and architecture, the change needs, and their observable triggers).

**Grilling mode** (one question at a time, recommended-answer-per-
question, walk-the-tree systematic): for foundation / high-stakes /
high-uncertainty / conflict-risk specs. Detail: REFERENCE.md.

### Solution-space exploration (REQUIRED)

Mechanic: `skills/frame/SKILL.md` (SoT). 8 sub-steps run inside the
interview. Especially: reformulate problem, first-principles drill
(`bedrock_drill` on foundation specs), ≥3 fundamentally different
approaches (null option allowed), happy/edge/effort/reversibility
evaluation. Bedrock map (when drilled) flows in as constraint source
— physics/logic axioms = hard constraints, YOUR-CHOICE = soft with
rationale. If a council fires after exploration: council gets frame
approaches as input (no fresh start).

## Phase 2 — Write the spec

When the interview moves to writing the spec, before drafting a new spec or section, and before locking a
recommendation or a named external or internal surface in it: read and follow `skills/spec_authoring/writing.md`
(artifact checklist, REQUIRED on every new spec, items 1–8; verify-before-recommend; integration-surface grounding,
REQUIRED; mediator pass-through audit; the 5 primitives).

## Phase 3 — intent_chain + alignment validation

`intent_chain` format / variants / inheritance rules:
`framework/intent-tree.md` (SoT). Required on delegation (`framework/invariants.md`
invariant 3); optional in direct conversation.

**Intent alignment validation** (MUST — receiving agents): every
agent that receives an intent_chain validates before its first plan
step. Distill received intent in one sentence; phrase own plan in
one sentence; check consistent yes/no; document. Deviation → STOP,
escalate. Direct user conversation without intent_chain: skip.

## Brief authoring (separate skill)

Brief-time MCA delegation artifact lives in `agents/brief-architect.md`,
not here. spec_authoring produces the spec; brief-architect produces
the per-task brief that translates spec → MCA-ready instructions.

## Amendments to existing specs

This skill covers **greenfield specs** and **new sections that need
an interview**. It does NOT cover mechanism-shift / class-rename /
contract-retraction amendments to locked specs — those go through
`brief-architect mode=spec_amendment` when the substantial-amendment
threshold fires.

**Amendment discipline** (pre-edit gate, dispatch threshold, dispatch
shape, greenfield-direct rationale): `_protocols/spec-amendment-discipline.md`.

## Why orchestrator-direct (no fresh-context architect)

Greenfield authoring is run by Buddy (interview + draft), not handed to
a fresh-context architect — deliberately, not as a gap. A fresh-context
architect (`brief-architect`) earns its keep where its value applies:
reading existing code + the spec corpus end-to-end and grounding claims
against them — its `brief`, `spec_amendment`, and `retro_spec_update`
modes each ground against an **existing** artifact. Greenfield authoring
has **no existing artifact to ground against** — the spec is being born —
so that value is moot. And the front-half is an irreducibly interactive
interview (multi-turn, user-in-the-loop); a one-shot context-isolated
agent cannot run it. Author-anchoring — the one real risk of Buddy
drafting what Buddy just interviewed — is caught by the independent
`spec_board` review, not by a redundant drafting handoff. Substantial
amendments to *locked* specs DO get the architect (`brief-architect
mode=spec_amendment`): there the existing spec + code are exactly what
must be ground against. So the "no architect at authoring" asymmetry is
principled — architect = grounding against an existing artifact;
greenfield has none.

## Contract

**INPUT:** user intent, no existing spec file for this scope,
access to `framework/spec-engineering.md` + `docs/specs/Spec header.md`.
Optional: scoping output, frame report.

**OUTPUT:** new spec under `docs/specs/`, SPEC-MAP entry, README
entry, failure-modes section, implementation-surface estimate.

**DOES NOT:** board review (→ `spec_board`), code, implementation,
brief authoring (→ `agents/brief-architect.md`).

**DONE:** spec file with header + content + failure modes +
implementation surface; SPEC-MAP bidirectional; README entry; 5
primitives applied.

**FAIL handling:** interview gaps → more rounds. User cannot answer
fundamental intent questions → ESCALATE back to scoping or intent.md
sharpening.

## Boundary

- No update of existing specs → `spec_update`.
- No board review → `spec_board`.
- No cross-spec verify → `spec_amendment_verification`.

## Anti-patterns

- **NOT** write spec without solution-space exploration. INSTEAD
  `frame` sub-steps 1-8 as required interview part.
- **NOT** treat failure modes as "I'll add later". INSTEAD required
  Phase 2 output.
- **NOT** treat `intent_chain` as checkbox. INSTEAD actively derive
  vision → operational → action.
- **NOT** author multiple new specs in parallel. INSTEAD sequential,
  full interview per spec.
- **NOT** ask "does the spec look complete?" as meta-question.
  INSTEAD identify specific uncertainties; ask sharp questions with
  agent's own recommendation attached.
- **NOT** lock structural-refactor on visible-edge analysis only.
  INSTEAD trace transitive import graph per
  `_protocols/mca-brief-template-verification.md` §Structural-refactor pre-lock
  checklist BEFORE brief locks the decision.
- **NOT** generate two-option questions from handoff/spec disagreement
  without code-grounding first.
- **NOT** assume mediator pass-through; verify it (3-question audit).
- **NOT** name an existing framework surface (enum / contract / gate /
  skill) without grounding it against the live SoT and citing `file:line`;
  a source task's claim about a third surface may be stale and propagates
  verbatim into the new spec.
- **NOT** write a state-bearing mechanism as one bullet per side (entry
  recipe, exit recipe, undo paragraph) spread over several specs.
  INSTEAD one `§Mechanism-Lifecycle` matrix in the owning spec, every
  cell filled, other specs pointing at it
  (`_protocols/mechanism-model.md`). Because: per-side prose is reviewed
  per side; the defects live in the cells nobody wrote.
