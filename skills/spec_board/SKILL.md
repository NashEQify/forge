description: >
  Multi-perspective review of whether an EXISTING spec is rebuild-ready —
  could an implementer rebuild it 1:1 from the spec alone? Use when a spec
  needs a quality check after writing and before build (completeness /
  consistency / contract / dependency gaps); reach for it instead of
  eyeballing a spec yourself. NOT for authoring a new spec (use
  spec_authoring) or syncing a spec to code (use retroactive_spec_update).

Read and follow `framework/work-principle.md` before taking up work.
Resolve this reference against the framework root; retain the consumer CWD.
Without Buddy (plugin): if this session holds no Buddy boot entry, run `python3 <root>/scripts/forge_setup.py offer-check` once, as its own call (`<root>`: two levels above this skill's folder); if it prints a line, pass that offer to the user in one sentence, then continue with this skill.


# Skill: spec-board

Buddy checklist. Detail: `REFERENCE.md`. Agent protocols:
`agents/_protocols/reviewer-base.md` + `spec-reviewer-protocol.md`.

Rebuild-ready means buildable from the spec together with the test matrix or the tests it names: behaviour at
contract level in the spec, its cases in the matrix or tests (`framework/spec-engineering.md` §Convention: spec
carriers).

Section numbers are skill-wide: §0, §3, §5 and §7–§10 here, §1–§2 in `depth-and-team.md`, §4–§4b in
`checklist-and-dispatch.md`, §3a and §6–§6a in `post-pass.md` (the stubs below say when to read each).

## 0. Plan + review (required without a frame)

Direct board dispatch without prior `frame`: plan block (scope /
tool / alternatives) + self-review + (non-trivial) `plan-adversary`
dispatch. With existing frame report: reference, don't re-run.
Templates + triggers: `_protocols/plan-review.md`.

## Mandatory adoption ownership

Before initiating a software review intended to satisfy a mandatory result,
readiness or completion boundary, load `skills/_protocols/evidence-pointer-schema.md`
§9. Resolve one exact owner and capture before dispatch. Declare code subject
state/output exclusions before enumeration and check that they omit no required
reviewed inputs. Use persisted-success capture stdout for producer metadata and
pass each assigned slot, scope/focus and history neutrally. Preserve complete
returns verbatim with actual actors, paths and raw-byte digests before consumption.
A canonical verdict path is only a locator; retain prior payloads before replacing
it. Buddy's explicit current decision selects the current reports of the final
applicable review and names any history; it answers each adoption diagnostic. Adopt it through `evidence-pointer-schema.md` §9, then check the applicable policy before any
mandatory result/readiness write or completion. Current negative evidence supports
repair; it grants no success permission. Identity does not replace substantive
coverage, source interpretation, severity/risk rules or authorization.

Standalone execution owns `agent-dispatch`; receive a caller-supplied exact owner
for nested execution and do not create another capture. Pass
`review_owner_workflow_id` and `review_owner_step_id` into the readiness consumer;
a separately tracked child retains its existing explicit parent identity.

## Process — common

1. Decide scope + depth (incl. foundation flag).
2. Assemble role-based team.
3. Dispatch context-isolated reviews; consolidate via chief.
4. Close NEEDS-WORK via fix-loop until 0C+0H.
5. Post-pass checks + task / commit / deploy cleanly closed.

## 1.–2. Depth mode and team composition

When deciding scope and depth mode and assembling the team, before dispatching the board and before each later
pass's team: read and follow `skills/spec_board/depth-and-team.md` (§1 depth mode: §1.0 proportionality gate with
the override floor and the pre-gate FAILs, §1.1 scoped pre-check and 4 checks; §2 team composition with the
architect-roots and implementer triggers and the cold seat after a mechanism redesign).

## 3. Flow

**Standard:** dispatch → chief (+ optional discourse) → chief synth
→ post-convergence check → SAVE → 0C+0H DONE; else escalate Deep.

**Post-convergence check (required after chief synth):** chief
answers in consolidated: (1) "Weakest point in PASS — what tips it?"
(2) "Which single-agent finding was downweighted the most — rightly so?"

**Deep:** pass 1 (7) → chief → DISCOURSE → chief → SAVE; pass 2+
(4) → chief → discourse → SAVE → fix → next; final (2) → Buddy direct.
Every fix from pass 2 on is preceded by the §4 step 10
Simplify-before-patch check.

Chief consolidation: analysis-mode gate
(`_protocols/analysis-mode-gate.md`) before findings classification.

### 3a. Delta-verify (standard mode, post-fix re-check)

After every relevant fix in standard mode, before re-checking: read and follow `skills/spec_board/post-pass.md` (§3a
delta-verify: exact-owner retry and fresh capture, the 2-agent delta re-check trigger, team and acceptance).

## Process — mode deep

Same flow as above; starts with pass 1 (7) and loops through pass 2+
(4) until convergence.

## Process — mode ux

UX review is not a separate skill. For UI-heavy specs `spec_board` runs in
`mode=ux` with UX personas (`board-ux-heuristic`, `board-ux-ia`,
`board-ux-interaction`) as extended team variant. Functional + UX
findings in same consolidated. When the change has a look and an
experience contract (`skills/ux_authoring/SKILL.md`), each UX seat's
prompt names both files with the behaviour spec as the review subject.

## 4.–4b. Buddy checklist, cross-task ACs and mechanism cells

When assembling prompts and dispatching reviewers, when the spec carries cross-subsystem ACs or a
`§Mechanism-Lifecycle` section in scope, and before a fix pass: read and follow
`skills/spec_board/checklist-and-dispatch.md` (§4 Buddy checklist for dispatch, including C-VERIFY and the
Simplify-before-patch check before fix pass ≥ 2; §4a cross-task AC validation; §4b mechanism cells as the review
unit, MUST before PASS).

## 5. Discourse

Deep: ALWAYS after chief. Standard: Buddy decision (proportional).
Mechanic: `_protocols/discourse.md`.

## 6.–6a. Post-pass and risk carry-forward

After each pass's consolidation, before closing the pass, and when unfixed findings are carried forward: read and
follow `skills/spec_board/post-pass.md` (§6 post-pass checklist, NON-NEGOTIABLE; §6a risk carry-forward, MANDATORY on
user-override / cherry-pick / valve-hit / ESCALATE-accepted).

## 7. Output paths

Reviews: `docs/reviews/board/{spec-name}-{role}-pass{N}.md`
Consolidated: `docs/reviews/board/{spec-name}-consolidated-pass{N}.md`
(task-qualified `{spec-name}-consolidated-task{id}-pass{N}.md` when
another task already owns the plain namespace). Pass files are history:
never rewrite their pointers after a spec amendment.

**Adoption verdict (the completion artifact):** for an applicable supported decision
(including NEEDS-WORK for evidence/repair),
Buddy writes `docs/reviews/board/{task_id}-spec-verdict.md` (build, and
review runs with a task); a task-less review run falls back to
`docs/reviews/board/{spec-name}-verdict.md`. Frontmatter `schema_version: 1`,
`adopted_from:` (the consolidated pass file), `reviewed_revision:` (commit of the
adopted spec) and an evidence block holding the verdict's pivotal pointers. Buddy
re-checks those pointers against the adopted spec himself (C-VERIFY); adoption
does not check the decision's own pointers mechanically. Include the §9 run/subject, explicit decision and current_reports slot/path/
digest/actor references; answer the adoption diagnostics in the decision.
Adopt before current use; `spec_success` permits only PASS without an unresolved mediator
audit marker in a captured file. Canonical copies must be
byte-identical to the retained decision; preserve earlier payloads before replacement.

## 7a. Review-mode variants

**Standard (default):** agents review per role; findings grouped by agent.
**5-dimensions (corpus sweeps):** agents additionally review along 5
quality dimensions; chief consolidates per dimension. Use after
`spec_update` or pre-launch sweep. Mechanics:
`spec_board/5-dimensions-review.md`.

## 8. Contract

**INPUT:** spec file, SPEC-MAP read; exact mandatory owner when nested. Optional: frame
report, engine context. Context: protocols (reviewer-base, spec-
reviewer-protocol, dispatch-template, consolidation-preservation,
piebald-budget).

**OUTPUT:** board verdict (PASS 0C+0H or NEEDS-WORK with severity
distribution), consolidated findings, tracking table on NEEDS-WORK,
`board_result` (machine-readable), review files under
`docs/reviews/board/`.

**DOES NOT:** fixes (Buddy/MCA work), code, spec authoring.

**DONE:** final applicable current decision adopted and spec_success checked;
verdict 0C+0H every required pass; tracking table complete;
merge + minority checks executed; all findings fixed; Delta-Verify
done if triggered; Task YAML updated; result persisted. Commit/push/deploy
follow `framework/process-map.md` §Authorization; retain any authorized
missing publication as an unresolved obligation. Local completion grants
no publication authority.

**FAIL handling:** NEEDS-WORK → fix → next pass (max 3 via
`convergence_loop`). Standard → Deep on ≥1C or ≥3H. After max →
ESCALATE.

## 9. Boundary

- Code review → `code_review_board`.
- Pre-code plan review → `impl_plan_review`.
- Legacy UX board → `mode=ux` here.
- As-is spec update → `spec_update` (writes before board reviews).

## 10. Anti-patterns

- **NOT** pass findings on without chief consolidation. INSTEAD
  check chief signal + tracking table (silent-loss prevention).
- **NOT** close standard without discourse when findings diverge.
  INSTEAD trigger discourse.
- **NOT** start spec fix as new full pass. INSTEAD scoped pre-check
  + delta review (pass inflation = wasted tokens).
- **NOT** dispatch agents without context isolation. INSTEAD every
  agent gets ONLY the spec (anchoring bias).
- **NOT** run §1.1's 4 checks before §1.0's proportionality gate.
  INSTEAD §1.0 first; security + full-path remain hard overrides.
- **NOT** skip the §Module-Decomposition OR §Test-Strategy pre-gate
  on a NEW L1+ spec by assuming legacy. INSTEAD verify creation-date
  or section-history before silent-skipping.


### Observational workflow checks

Navigation/recovery never execute commands. Use existing authorized tools for
actions and observe their actual current outcome. The manual action checkpoints
require nonblank evidence supplied with the current `--complete --evidence`
invocation, including force. Missing/failed/timed-out/unknown outcomes stay open
with the concrete blocker; no-new-commit save still requires current persistence
observations for applicable project/user roots and required remotes. Completion
is agent-confirmed, never engine proof of free-text truth or remote correctness.
See `framework/workflow-engine-cookbook.md` for the retained completion contract.
